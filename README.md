code for a deadlock free environment in the kitchen
Assume a kitchen has n chief working. If each chef can claim atmost 'r' ingredients(each ingredients is kept in a jar),then find out the total number of ingredients that are present in the kitchen having deadlock free execution of work. Write a code to implement the above situation.

Expected outcomes:

1. Deadlock free scenario: The program should be able to create a deadlock free situation as per the above mentioned scenario

2. Explanation about the deadlock free algorithm has been implemented

3. At least 5 test cases should be mentioned to test the scenario

Simulation results: The program should run the simulation for a set of values and and should display both deadlock and deadlock free environment, Also there should be valid logic behind choosing a set of ingredients for a deadlock free scenario
